\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid spata-object.}

\item{of_sample}{The sample(s) of interest specified as a single character value or vector.
If set to \emph{""} (the default) the first sample is chosen.}

\item{color_to}{The variable to be displayed by color specified as .

 \itemize{
  \item{ \strong{Gene set} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
  \item{ \strong{Genes} as a character vector. If more than one gene is specified the average
  expression of those genes will be calculated and displayed. Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
  \item{ \strong{Feature} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getFeaturenNames()}}
  }}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will be handled
specified as a character of length one. This can be either \emph{'mean'} or one
of \emph{'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'}. The latter four will be given to
\code{gsva::GSVA()}.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be smoothed according to the
\code{smoooth_}-parameters.}

\item{smooth_span}{The amount of smoothing specified as a single numeric value.}

\item{pt_size}{The size of the points specified as a single numeric value.}

\item{pt_alpha}{The transparency of the points specified as single numeric value.}

\item{pt_clrsp}{The color spectrum to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is continuous. Run \code{all_colorspectra()} to see valid input..}

\item{pt_clrp}{The color panel to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is categorical/discrete. Run \code{all_colorpanels()} to see valid input.}

\item{display_image}{Logical. If set to TRUE the histology image of the specified sample
is displayed underneath the plot.}

\item{display_title}{Logical. If set to TRUE an informative title is displayed.}

\item{assign}{Logical. If set to TRUE a named list will be assigned to the global
environment. This list contains data and information to rebuild or additionally
customize the output plot of this function.}

\item{assign_name}{The name the assigned list is supposed to have specified as
a single character value.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing at least the variables \emph{'x'} and \emph{'y'}.}

\item{image}{An image of class \emph{Image} to be displayed in the background.
Easily accessible via \code{SPATA::image()}.}
}
\description{
Displays the sample and colors the surface according to the
expression of genes and gene sets or other featured characteristics.

\itemize{
 \item{ \code{plotSurface()} Takes the spata-object as the starting point and creates the
 necessary data.frame from scratch according to additional parameters.}
 \item{ \code{plotSurface2()} Takes a data.frame as the starting point.}
 \item{ \code{plotSurfaceInteractive()} Takes only the spata-object and opens a mini-shiny
 application which allows for interactive plotting.}
