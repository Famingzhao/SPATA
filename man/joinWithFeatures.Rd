\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid spata-object.}

\item{coords_df}{A data.frame that contains at least the character variables
\emph{samples} and \emph{barcodes}.}

\item{features}{The features of interest specified as a character vector.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be smoothed according to the
\code{smoooth_}-parameters.}

\item{smooth_span}{The amount of smoothing specified as a single numeric value.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{genes}{The genes of interest specified as a character vector.}

\item{gene_sets}{The gene sets of interest specified as a character vector.}

\item{method_gs}{The method according to which gene sets will be handled
specified as a character of length one. This can be either \emph{mean} or one
of \emph{gsva, ssgsea, zscore, or plage}. The latter four will be given to
\code{gsva::GSVA()}.}

\value{
The input data.frame of \code{coords_df} joined with all the aspects
specified variables specified in \code{features} by the key \emph{barcodes}.

\description{
Each member of the \code{joinWith()}-family takes a data.frame as
input that contains at least the variables \emph{barcodes} and \emph{sample}.
(Easily obtained with the \code{spata::coords()}-family.) It joins them over
 the \emph{barcodes}-variable with a specified aspect.
