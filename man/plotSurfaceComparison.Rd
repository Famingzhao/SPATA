  object,

  color_to,

\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid object of class \emph{spata}.}

\item{of_sample}{The samples name specified as a character of length one.}

\item{color_to}{The genes and gene sets whoose expression you want to
compare specified as a character vector or a list.}

\item{method_gs}{The method according to which gene sets will be handled
specified as a character of length one. This can be either \emph{mean} or one
of \emph{gsva, ssgsea, zscore, or plage}. The latter four will be given to
\code{gsva::GSVA()}. Ignored if \code{color_to} isn't a gene set.}

\item{smooth}{Logical value. If set to TRUE \code{plotSurface()} will smooth
the values displayed by color deploying \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value, given to \code{stats::loess()} if
\code{smooth} is set to TRUE.}

\item{pt_size}{The size of the points specified as a numeric value.}

\item{pt_alpha}{The transparency of the points specified as a numeric value.}

\item{pt_clrsp}{The colour spectrum used to display \code{color_to} if the
specified variable is continuous. Needs to be one of \emph{inferno, magma,
plasma, cividis or viridis}.}

\item{display_image}{Logical value to specify whether the histological image
of the sample is supposed to be displayed underneath the plot.

(Can be made visible with low \code{pt_alpha} or \code{color_to} set to NULL.)}

\item{verbose}{Logical value to specify whether informative messages are
supposed to be printed or not.}

\item{display_title}{Logical value to specify whether a title is supposed to
be displayed.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot-object that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.
}
\description{
Plots a surface plot for every valid element in argument
\code{color_to} and colors the surface according to the expression of
genes and gene sets.
